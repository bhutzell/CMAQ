!!! The following line defines the tag classes to track for the simulation. Species in NITRATE and VOC classes depend on the
!!! the chemical mechanism used. The below definitions apply for the cb6r3_ae7_aq mechanism.
!!!   Choose any/all from the list of nine:  SULFATE, NITRATE, AMMONIUM, EC, OC, VOC, PM25_IONS, CO, OZONE 
!!!   SULFATE   - ASO4J, ASO4I, SO2, SULF, SULRXN
!!!   NITRATE   - ANO3J, ANO3I, HNO3, NO, NO2, NO3, HONO, N2O5, PNA, PAN, PANX, NTR1, NTR2, INTR, CLNO2, CLNO3
!!!   AMMONIUM  - ANH4J, ANH4I, NH3
!!!   EC        - AECJ, AECI
!!!   OC        - APOCI, APOCJ, APNCOMI, APNCOMJ
!!!   VOC       - Various species depending on mechanism. Now includes CO. (see CCTM/src/isam/SA_DEFN.F for complete list)
!!!   PM25_IONS - ANAI, ANAJ, AMGJ, AKJ, ACAJ, AFEJ, AALJ, ASIJ, ATIJ, AMNJ, AOTHRI, AOTHRJ
!!!   OZONE     - all NITRATE species + all VOC species
!!!   CHLORINE  - ACLI, ACLJ, HCL

TAG CLASSES     |SULFATE, OZONE

!!! The following are source definition text blocks in the format:
!!!   TAG NAME        |Three character text string
!!!   REGION(S)       |Keyword EVERYWHERE or variable names from the region file (multiple regions need to be comma delimited)
!!!   FILENAME(S)     |Emissions labels (multiple labels need to be comma delimited)


TAG NAME        |GR1
REGION(S)       |EVERYWHERE
EMIS STREAM(S)  |GRIDDED_EMIS

!!! The below tag definition is an example of a source with an regional emissions stream.
!!! Regions are described by netcdf files defined in the CCTM run script. They may be 
!!! based on individual variables from those netcdf inputs or by groups of variables 
!!! using the RegionFamilies feature. For more information, read the ISAM chapter and 
!!! Appendix B in the Users Grid under the repository's DOCS directory.
!!!TAG NAME        |NEG
!!!REGION(S)       |NC
!!!EMIS STREAM(S)  |PT_EGU
